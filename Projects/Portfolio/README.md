# React + VITE + Tailwind

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Project Setup:

	1. Create project using this Link: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

		NOTE: After the Step 1. in the link, Do npm install.
		
	2. Collect Required images in SVG format and place them in Assests Folder.

	3. Install React icon library : npm i nanoid react-icons

	4. Install required Extensions in VScode: Tailwind CSS IntelliSense and Tailwind Fold 
	
	  ( This extension helps improve the readability of your code by automatically "folding" long class attributes.)

	5. Build: npm run build, launch: npm run dev whereas in webpack npm build and npm start
